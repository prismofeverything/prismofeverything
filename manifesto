The Prism of Everything is a living rhythmic fabric that is always present. Through its churning cycle it generates everything we know and everything unknown. In one end enters the Essence, the perfect emptiness, and out the other spins a kaleidoscope of all creation. We are shards in its great wheel, and we reflect the light that emanates from its core. Through it we are all united as the leaves on a mighty tree. A tree of pure energy and potential and fountain of raw creation. You are unavoidably immersed in its power, inseparable from the spinning features surrounding you. Dissolve, and feel your essence merge with its original source. Become the Prism of Everything, and feel creation flow from you.
